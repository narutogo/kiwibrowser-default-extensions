# kiwibrowser-default-extensions
I want know how add a default extension for kiwibrowser(https://github.com/kiwibrowser/src) based chromium so I create this.
I have try different methods, but not work as follow:
  1. in stackoverflow have desktop pre-installed extension method for desktop chromium but it not work in mobile.
  2. by command-line for android in /data/local/tmp/chrome-command-line define extension by --load-extens not work.
  3. change /data/data/com.kiwibrowser.browser.classic/Default/Preference by adb, but this file will be change by auto , I do not know why, it not work.
